Start with a main function and make each problem a function. Call those functions from your main function.

### Problem 2:
Create a function to ask the user to enter the extra credit they earned. If they entered less than 5 print “That’s not enough extra credit.” If they entered more than 20 print “That’s too much extra credit”.

### Problem 3:
Create a function to ask a user to enter a password. Enter a password. Ask user to reenter password. Check to see if they are correct.
